The above links are the top and center focal point on PoolTogether's audit page.
Two conducted by OpenZeppelin and two by QuantStamp.

If MAD was able to get two audits from each that show we are minimal risk, 
we would be in business to attract a mainstream audience still uncertain and 
scared of crypto/DeFi. Even though our model is useing the interest on a stable coin, most are not aware of the economies transition from FIAT to completely digital currencies. 

The overall goal of MAD should be to maintain complete transparancy with users
by providing honest 3rd party audit results. On top of transparancy, if we could 
educate, in the simplest terms, why decentralised finance will benefit
artists and young business folks to have a fair stake in the redistribution of 
wealth during these unprecedented times..
