Making an Modern Artists DAO

Kevin is setting up the game plan and getting finding handled

Dereks in the blockchain business already


Entering Chainlink Hackathon with this idea

-build is based on:
      Pool Together - has the interface and most
                      of the game rules we want
                      except we dont want a winner, we want a governance system to give money to artists 
     
      Yearn.finance - has the governance protocol we want
     
      curve.fi - just a reference
      
These are the three main stable coin protocols
I'll need to audit before next meeting

-compund 
-aave
 
Lesser known tokens


(use mozilla for less wallet clash than Brave)
